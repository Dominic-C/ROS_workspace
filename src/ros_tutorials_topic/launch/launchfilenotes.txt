The main tag is a <launch> tag, and ends with a </launch>.

within the node tag, there are 3 parameters

pkg : package name

type : Name of actual node to be executed (Node name)

name : The executable name to be used when the node corresponding to the type is executed.

multiple similar publishers and subscribers will publish and subscribe to all nodes. We add namespaces to avoid this. Thus one subscriber can subscribe to a specific
publisher. This is done by the <group> tag
**note, no spaces should be present in the names of groups etc.
